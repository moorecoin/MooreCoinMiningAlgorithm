.sh description
this  manual page documents the bitcoind program. bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. peer-to-peer (p2p) means that there is no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transactions. instead, these tasks are managed collectively by the nodes of the network. advantages:

bitcoins can be sent easily through the internet, without having to trust middlemen. transactions are designed to be irreversible. be safe from instability caused by fractional reserve banking and central banks. the limited inflation of the bitcoin system鈥檚 money supply is distributed evenly (by cpu power) throughout the network, not monopolized by banks.
