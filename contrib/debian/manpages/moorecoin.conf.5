.th bitcoin.conf "5" "january 2011" "bitcoin.conf 3.19"
.sh name
bitcoin.conf \- bitcoin configuration file
.sh synopsis
all command-line options (except for '\-conf') may be specified in a configuration file, and all configuration file options may also be specified on the command line. command-line options override values set in the configuration file.
.tp
the configuration file is a list of 'setting=value' pairs, one per line, with optional comments starting with the '#' character.
.tp
the configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using your favorite plain-text editor. by default, bitcoind(1) will look for a file named bitcoin.conf(5) in the bitcoin data directory, but both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the '\-datadir' and '\-conf' command-line arguments.
.sh location
bitcoin.conf should be located in $home/.bitcoin
