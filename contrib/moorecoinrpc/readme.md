### bitrpc
allows for sending of all standard bitcoin commands via rpc rather than as command line args.

### looking for wallet tools?
bitrpc.py is able to do the exact same thing as `walletchangepass.py` and `walletunlock.py`. their respective commands in bitrpc.py are:

	bitrpc.py walletpassphrasechange
	bitrpc.py walletpassphrase
