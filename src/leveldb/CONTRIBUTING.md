# contributing

we'd love to accept your code patches! however, before we can take them, we
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

## contributor license agreements

please fill out either the individual or corporate contributor license
agreement as appropriate.

* if you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
own the intellectual property, then sign an [individual cla](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
* if you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
then sign a [corporate cla](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate cla and
instructions for how to sign and return it.

## submitting a patch

1. sign the contributors license agreement above.
2. decide which code you want to submit. a submission should be a set of changes
that addresses one issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/google/leveldb/issues).
please don't mix more than one logical change per submission, because it makes
the history hard to follow. if you want to make a change
(e.g. add a sample or feature) that doesn't have a corresponding issue in the
issue tracker, please create one.
3. **submitting**: when you are ready to submit, send us a pull request. be
sure to include the issue number you fixed and the name you used to sign
the cla.

## writing code ##

if your contribution contains code, please make sure that it follows 
[the style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml).
otherwise we will have to ask you to make changes, and that's no fun for anyone.
